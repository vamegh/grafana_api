# grafana_api
A simple utility / class to communicate with the grafana api, to get and post datasources.


The class / lib is very basic right now and only works on datasources, but can easily be extended to work on anything that can be done with the grafana api.

This can be used when provisioning new grafana instances, to populate it with dashboards and datasources (with some work).

If you find this useful and do extend it, please let me know and please send back the updates.
